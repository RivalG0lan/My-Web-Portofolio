          <h3>Project Multimedia GUI Roblox Studio</h3>
          <p>
            This project involved leading the UI/UX division in designing and
            implementing a graphical user interface for a Roblox map named
            <strong>Medan Heritage</strong>, developed as a final assignment for
            the Multimedia Theory II course. The design process began in Figma
            and was later realized in Roblox Studio, while Lua programming was
            used to support interactive elements within the game environment.

          <h3>Project Database Hotel Booking</h3>
          <p>
            This project involved building a database using realistic anonymized
            data sourced from Kaggle, centered on hotel tourism booking records.
            The dataset was normalized from UNF through 3NF to reduce redundancy
            and prevent data anomalies. To simplify the implementation process,
            the data was converted from Excel to Google Sheets before being
            imported into phpmyadmin via XAMPP.

          <p>
            This project focused on designing and simulating a computer network
            topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network was built using core
            networking principles, including hardware configuration, LAN
            cabling, subnet-based IP addressing, inter-router routing, and DHCP
            pool setup to enable automatic IP allocation for client devices
            connecting through access points.
